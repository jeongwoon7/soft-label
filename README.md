# Utilizing soft labels of Convolutional Neural Networks for predicting quantum transmission probability: An application to high-dimensional data prediction

by Moon-Hyun Cha and Jeongwoon Hwang, submitted

1. Data for ML models
* Image data mimicking quantum dot chains: test_lhc, test_normal, test_uniform
* Each of them are generated by Latin hypercube sampling, random sampling with normal distribution, random sapling with uniform distribution
* In each directory, there're figures and corresponding labels (transmission probility data represented by 1000 data points)
